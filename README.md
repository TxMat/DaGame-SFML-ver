# DaGame (SFML)

[![CI](https://github.com/TxMat/DaGame-SFML-ver/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/TxMat/DaGame-SFML-ver/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Installation

1. If you use Linux, install SFML's dependencies using your system package manager. On Ubuntu and other Debian-based distributions you can use the following commands:
    ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install \
        libxrandr-dev \
        libxcursor-dev \
        libudev-dev \
        libfreetype-dev \
        libopenal-dev \
        libflac-dev \
        libvorbis-dev \
        libgl1-mesa-dev \
        libegl1-mesa-dev
    ```
2. Configure and build your project. Most popular IDEs support CMake projects with very little effort on your part.
    - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) via the [CMake extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux)
    - [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170)
    - [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/features/cmake-support.html)
    - [Qt Creator](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-project-cmake.html)

    Using CMake from the command line is straightforward as well.

    For a single-configuration generator (typically the case on Linux and macOS):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```

    For a multi-configuration generator (typically the case on Windows):
    ```
    cmake -S . -B build
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```
3. Enjoy!

## Development

### But I want to...

Modify CMake options by adding them as configuration parameters (with a `-D` flag) or by modifying the contents of CMakeCache.txt and rebuilding.

### Use Static Libraries

By default, SFML builds shared libraries and this default is inherited by your project.
CMake's [`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/BUILD_SHARED_LIBS.html) option lets you pick static or shared libraries for the entire project.

### Change Compilers

See the variety of [`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER.html) options.
In particular, you'll want to modify `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER` to point to the C++ compiler you wish to use.

### Change Compiler Optimizations

CMake abstracts away specific optimizer flags through the [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html) option.
By default, this project recommends `Release` builds which enable optimizations.
Other build types include `Debug` builds which enable debug symbols but disable optimizations.
If you're using a multi-configuration generator (as is often the case on Windows), you can modify the [`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES.html#variable:CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES) option.

### Change Generators

While CMake will attempt to pick a suitable default generator, some systems offer a number of generators to choose from.
Ubuntu, for example, offers Makefiles and Ninja as two potential options.
For a list of generators, click [here](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).
To modify the generator you're using you must reconfigure your project providing a `-G` flag with a value corresponding to the generator you want.
You can't simply modify an entry in the CMakeCache.txt file unlike the above options.
Then you may rebuild your project with this new generator.
